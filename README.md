## Title: Exploring the Preprocessing of a Time-Series Administrative Healthcare Dataset on Deep Learning to Improve Prediction
### Abstract:

Preprocessing methods are important in enhancing prediction performance for time-series administrative data. This study underscores the importance of preprocessing methods by comparing two data representation techniques that can be used with sliding window techniques for time-series administrative healthcare data for use with gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. The first method uses a sequence event representation and the second employs a sequence matrix representation. The evaluation was conducted through a retrospective administrative healthcare data case study to predict multiple outcomes. The target outcomes were the first instances of healthcare encounters indicating homelessness or police interaction that appeared in the healthcare data. Results reveal that the GRU combined with sequence matrix representation and sliding window outperformed the sequence of events with the sliding window by over 20% in area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity for both outcomes. Given the data used in this analysis, sequence matrix representation was superior to sequence event representation while using GRU models. The results remained consistent across the evaluation in real-world clinical frameworks using two trigger methods for prediction time, such as the sliding window and clinical demand window structures.
