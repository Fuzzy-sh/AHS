# Exploring the Impact of Preprocessing Techniques for Building a Real-Time Prediction Tool using Time-Series Medical Data

By using program languages (Python), we can extract important data from these records, including International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, which are used to classify and code diagnoses, symptoms, and medical procedures.

# Here are the files and the explanation for each files.


## 1-top_level_script_fuzzy_parameters_jobArrays.sh

The purpose of the code is to generate parameter files for different jobs associated with two separate databases (dad and nacrs). These parameter files will be used to run simulations, with each set of parameters representing an individual in the database. To achieve this, the code initializes a job counter and sets a step size for the parameter range. It then removes any pre-existing parameter files and loops over the parameter range to create a set of parameters for each job.
